Nov 15, 2020: remove O_kk_si_compensating_sources, O_kk_variable_sipr 
   and O_kk_si options for test with Kiel version
   o_diat similar patters but much larger values (80) compared to Kiel version (0.003)	
   o_diatnpp is smaller, thus can't be the reason for larger o_diat
   o_diatgraz, o_diatmort and o_diatrecy are smaller by 10^2, so this can be the reason
   switch of n15, c13 and c14 isotopes
   fixed rgraz_Diat, rnpp_Diat ... statements in npzd_src.F
   now o_diat ~1 (but it shouldn't have been affected by the rgraz statements, which only change the output)
   but now o_diatgraz = 0 	and o_diatnpp=e-19

Nov 16: fixd diatnpp_dop output 
   but diatnpp still ~e-19 much smaller than phytnpp ~10-9
   O_npzd_extra_diagnostics seems broken (netcdf error putvaramsk O_wcdeni)
   but only in combination with O_iron_diagnostics

Nov 17: fixed zpref
    test with converting diatoms to calcifiers
    mort, morpt and graz of diatoms all zero in output
    fixed error in npzd.h and now diatoms are identical to coccs :-)

Nov 18: adopting Karin's parameters for diatoms seems to 
    with constant kfe_Diat Diatoms dominate
    with variable kfevar_Diat they are less dominant

Nov 19: 1-year test run with variable kfevars
   1-year test run with Karen's parameters in const_kfe/karen
	this leads to total phytoplankton domination
   try to tune kfe in const_kfe to get more equal PFT distributions

   converting only one PFT (phyt) to variale kfe increases its biomass everywhere, both 
   in oligotrophic and eutrophic regions. This is kind of interesting as it indicates
   variable kfe makes a PFT more competitive (perhaps not surprising)

Nov 20: 100-yr tests with constant and variable kfe all result in diatoms retreating 
   into the subtropics, while phyt dominate including the high latitude SO

   decrease kfemax for coccs and diatoms from 0.6 and 1.5 to 0.5 and 1
Nov 21: this leads to less dominance for phyt, more diat is SO and coccs dominate subtropics
   strongly negative values for diat develop after ~year 5

   remove si limitation for diat in npzd_src.F to make all phytoplankton identical
   small differences (e-7) remain between diat and phyt, whereas phyt and cocc are identical
   pattern looks like freshwater fluxes
   fixed error in gasbc.F
   diat and phyt identical :-) (after 30 days) 
   integrating longer leads to differences
   diaz negative

Nov 23: cocc and phyt diverge after about year 20. Seem identical before that. Strange. 
   larger initial differences between phyt and diat despite identical parameters.
   One solution could be to add an array for all phytplankton in MOBI to guarantee each
   PFT is treated exactly the same way. It may also be useful for future PFT additions.

   recompile
   mv tavg.00010.01.01.nc tavg.00010.01.01.nc.1
   start new run

Dec 4: set all kefemin=kefemax=0.1e-3
	diaz still go extinct quickly
	set u_D=u_P
	this leads to diaz domination!
	revert back to u_D =\= u_P but with jdiar=1
	now diaz smaller than phyt but nonzero

Dec 7: replace 2.6 with dbct_D in npzd_src.F
   introduce kirr for light limitation
   diaz distribution looks OK
   cp O_diffac.nc, O_tidenrg_green and O_feflux from 07

Dec 8: make diaz like phyt, use same morp and morpt formulation and add no3flag to NPP
    and set dbct_D=0 and jdiar=1. This works. Now all pfts are identical. (eqal_pfts)

    Back to test_08: this is a good starting point. The differences between phyt and diaz
    are only due to the things mentioned in the above paragraph.

    Now change diatoms: increase abio, k1n and kfe
    diat1: diat dominate at high latitudes
    diat2: increase k1n and kfe for phyt and cocc leads to dominance of diatoms almost
           everywhere except in the subtropical gyres
	   both diat1 and diat2 have increasing surface NO3, PO4 and DFe indicating too little
	   productivity
    diat3: increase abio: only makes surface nutr increase larger
    diat2.1: include Si limitation: minimal effect. Why?
	Because k1si is too small in Aumont et al. 2003 formulation (no Si limitation anywhere)
	This is because Si varies from ~0.5 to 50 mmol/m3 and for Si = 1 k1si = 1 and for
	Si = 10 k1si = 2.6
	I just set k1si = 5, which leads to Si limitation in the subtropics


Dec 9: P is conserved (pl_ocean_P_budget_diat)
   run diat2.1 longer, surface NO3, PO4 too high
   diat4: increase growth rates (abio)    
          improves surface PO4 but not NO3

Dec 10: fixed dfesur output in embm_tsi.F
   diat5: increase growth rates
          leads to diat much reduced
   diat4.1: increase sinking spead to 20
   	    better surface PO4, but still too low
   diat4_si: switch on O_kk_si: crashes; crash is due to not all *.f files
   	     properly updated in code. rm diago.f and mk e resolves the issue
   	     cp tracer.F from ../si to remove hydrothermal and river sources
	     model works, but shows small drift in Si
	     sfc NO3, PO4 slightly too high, sfc Sil much too high

Dec 11: 
   diat4.2: wd0=25
   diat4.3: wd0=30

   check ropk calculation; different from rcak calculation

   diat6: variable kfe for diatoms
   diat6.1: variable kfe for diat, phyt & cocc

Dec 12: Ward et al. 2012 LO suggest all nutrient half saturation constants
    should depend on size. E.g. their table 2 has kn = 0.17*vol^0.27 where
    vol is the cell volume in um^3. kfe = 80e-6*vol^0.27. Thus kn should
    increase as kfe. For vol=10^0 (pico) kn=0.17, for vol=10^2 (nano) kn=0.59,
    for vol=10^4 kn=2, for vol=10^6 (micro) kn=7. 
    Sinking speed should also scale with size:
    w = 0.28vol^0.39. At vol=10^0 w = 0.3, vol=10^2 w = 1.7, vol=10^4 w=10,
    vol=10^6 w=61. Nutrient uptake (maximum growth) rates should decrease with 
    size for each PFT (Fig. 3 in Ward). 

Dec 14: To use model biomass in size dependent parameterizations I converted
    the Ward x-axis into total phytoplankton biomass (see ferret/pl_kn_vol.jnl)
    assuming a constant biomass density. But for a parameterization like the
    one used in Nickelson kfe = (P1*kfemin+P2*kfemax)/(P1+P2) one needs PFT
    biomass for P1 and P2. Not sure if this would work.

    diat7: as diat6.1 but variable half sat for NO3: 
    	   results almost identical to diat6.1
	   this indicates no N-limitation

Dec 15:
   thetaZ in no nitrogen case should not have kzoo multiplied by redptn since
   units are still in N! I've removed redptn there.

Dec 18: 
    diat7_si: as diat7 but with kk_si and tracer.F from diat4_si
    works but PO4 in Arctic gets large negative values
    start woring to include opal and to more Si calculation into npzd_src

Dec 21: remove po4_in, no3_in, dic13_in and din15_in from mobi_driver call and 
    replace by tnpzd(k,imobi*)

questions for Chris:
   in npzd_src is a line:
   dopupt_D_flag = dopupt_flag
   is this correct? Same flag for diazotrophs as for phyt

questions for Karin:
   k1n_C = 0.35 or k1p_C = 0.02 uM = 20 nM much larger than 4 nM suggested
   by LeQuere et al. 2005
   
   dbct_D is inconsistently applied in npzd_src (once zero, once 2.6)

   we could include variable diatom Si:C and Si:N due to Fe limitation
   
TODO: inconsistent units: DIC, ALK, O2, Si, OPL in mol/m^3, all other in mmol/m^3
      re-write code so that all tracers use consistent units

      simplify call of routines: right now many variables are explicitly listed as input/output 
      this could be removed by using the corresponding variables from common blocks.
diat7_si
Jan 11, 2021: fixed O_sil initial conditions file
	runs!
	diatoms get negative at Amazon (freshwater?)
Jan 12: much lower diat than ../diat7
	check Si units in npzd_src 
	change k1si to mol from mmol
	diat looks good now
	At month 7 large Si in tropics
	opl gets negative at l=4
	opl export is zero
	caco3 dissolution rate negative
Jan 13: fixed but in calciate dissolution
    	max(0.,(1.-Omega_c)) to limit dissl > 0
Mar 02: opal has right order of magnitude but decreases over time and surface 
	values are too low
	uses constant sinking speed (50 m/d) and dissolution rate for opal such
	that e-folding depth = 6 km 
	include bioopl = max(bioopl, trcmin) in npzd_src.F
	this resolves the negative opl issue
	set up longer run

	replaced all O_kk_si and O_kk_diat with O_mobi_silicon
 
Mar 4, 2021: copied from ../diat7_si
  remove O_kk_diat and O_kk_si from mk.in
  model compiles
  checked code vs ../diat7_si
	some differences in diago.F regarding O_carbon_carbonate_chem 
  removed redundant calc of k0 in co2calc.F (as part of k0_as_solubility option)
  removed other options from co2calc.F and made pressure dependent calcs default
    pressure dependent calcs needed for CaCO3 dissolution
  replaced all O_npzd* options with O_mobi*
  replaced 12.6 with 12.5 in format statements in diago.F to get rid of warning
  mv npzd.h mobi.h
  mv npzd_src.F mobi.F
  create fake npzd.h and npzd_src.F files to avoid deleting them in base source dir
  model crashes after Si becomes negative in year 2 (September)
	this happens in surface NAtl
  limit si>0 in mobi.F 
	this fixes the negative Si issue and crash
  P is conserved :-)
  model is stable but Si has decreasing trend (conservation issue)
  also surface Si is too high

Mar 5: add opal export at bottom (rexpoopl) back to silica (mobi.F) 
    mv output to .0
    this seems to fix conservations issue o_opl+o_sil much more stable
    increase sipr0 to 0.2 (from 0.13)
    rename npzd namelist mobi (mobi.F)
Mar 9: O_sil_dep has months at k-index, but still seems to work
  atmospheric silicon deposition is still on, which maybe what's causing 
    the increasing Si trend
Mar 10: much too large vertical ALK gradient
