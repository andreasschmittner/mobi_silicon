This is working code for developing and testing MOBI2.0 with silicon cycling (mainly from Karin Kvale) and a prognostic equation for opal.
Note of caution: this model is not tuned and has only been run for a short test run
Mar 4, 2021: copied from ../diat7_si
  remove O_kk_diat and O_kk_si from mk.in
  model compiles
  checked code vs ../diat7_si
	some differences in diago.F regarding O_carbon_carbonate_chem 
  removed redundant calc of k0 in co2calc.F (as part of k0_as_solubility option)
  removed other options from co2calc.F and made pressure dependent calcs default
    pressure dependent calcs needed for CaCO3 dissolution
  replaced all O_npzd* options with O_mobi*
  replaced 12.6 with 12.5 in format statements in diago.F to get rid of warning
  mv npzd.h mobi.h
  mv npzd_src.F mobi.F
  create fake npzd.h and npzd_src.F files to avoid deleting them in base source dir
  model crashes after Si becomes negative in year 2 (September)
	this happens in surface NAtl
  limit si>0 in mobi.F 
	this fixes the negative Si issue and crash
  P is conserved :-)
