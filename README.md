This is working code for developing and testing MOBI2.0 with silicon cycling (mainly from Karin Kvale) and a prognostic equation for opal.
*Note of caution:* this model is not tuned and has only been run for a short test run

External sources and sinks for silicon are zero.
Opal sinks with a prescribed constant velocity 'wo' and remineralizes at a constant rate.

Initial code provided by Samar Khatiwala is in the 08 updates at https://github.com/andreasschmittner/UVic2.9. You need that code to run this version (see mk.in).
